FINANCE 407 
Multinational Financial Management 
Fall 2024
Course Description: This course will familiarize students with financial   decision making in   an
international environment. Major topics covered include exchange rate risk and hedging, international   debt and equity financing, and international investment decisions.   FIN   305W   is   a prerequisite.
Materials: (1)          Textbook: “International Financial Management”, Tenth Edition, by Eun, Resnick,   and
Chuluun. ISBN: 978-1-264-41309-6. You may also use an older   edition.
(2)       Lecture notes will be available for   download   on   Canvas.   I recommend you print   them   out   and   write   on   them, by   hand, during   lectures. Lecture notes are incomplete – you          will need to take notes during class. 
(3)       Top Hat. We will use Top Hat   for   in-class   questions.   Instructions to   follow. Answering for someone else is a violation of academic integrity. This activity will result in an 
Academic Integrity Incident Report and zero credit for class participation and class performance for the entire semester. 
(4) One business calculator. You should bring your   calculator to   class   each   day because   Top Hat questions and in-class exercises   are often   quantitative.
Evaluation: Homework (0%): Questions and problems will be posted on Canvas   for practice.
Homework is not collected.
Quizzes (70%): There will be six quizzes over the   semester. The   first   five   quizzes   are   worth   15% each. The sixth quiz is worth   10%. The   date   for the   final   quiz will be announced later in the semester. Of the first five quizzes, your lowest quiz score will be dropped at the end of the semester. 
Excused absences for quizzes include illnesses, family emergencies,   military   service,   and religious observance. If   you are ill, you must provide a note from a doctor   indicating   you    were advised to take rest on the day of   the quiz. A note   indicating you visited   a   clinic   is insufficient. You must notify me prior to the quiz if   you are unable to take a   quiz   for your absence to be excused.
Class Participation (15%): To receive full credit for class participation,   you must   answer at least 50% of   in-class questions.

There   maybe   times   when   missing   class   is   unavoidable, due   to   illness, interviews, etc.
You will not be explicitly penalized for missing class, but the more classes you miss, the   more difficult it will be to earn full credit for   class participation   and   class performance.
Please   inform   me   of   any   extenuating   circumstances   that   may   affect   your   class   attendance.
Community Help Board: Please visit the “Discussions” tab in Canvas. Here you can post questions   related   to   the   course and receive feedback from other students. The purpose of   this board   is to   create    collaboration   and   group   learning   across   sections   ofFIN   407.
Grading: The standard   grading   scale   applies   (93%+   =   A,   90%-92%   =   A-,   87%-89%   =   B+,   84%-
86% = B, etc.). If   necessary, grades will be curved such that   the   class   average   across   all   sections is   at least   a   B+.
Class Etiquette: 
I ascribe to the golden rule of   classroom etiquette: Your behavior. should not distract me or, more importantly, your fellow students. Feel   free   to   impress the   class   with your maturity. 
Please arrive early for class to allow yourself   time to get   settled   so we   can begin   class   promptly. Also, please   turn   off   cellphones   and   other   electronic   devices   during   class.    Laptop computers are not needed during lectures and are   a   distraction to both the user   and other students in the class. As such, my recommendation is   that   laptop   computers   should be closed during lectures.
Miscellaneous: 
Announcements about the class and various course materials will be posted on Canvas,   so be   sure to check Canvas regularly. It is your responsibility to keep apprised of   important developments pertaining to the course. 
The course outline is tentative. Do not be concerned if   we   get   a   little   ahead   or behind the   schedule.   Changes to the schedule, if   necessary, will be announced in class and   on   Canvas.
This is a challenging course. You should   expect to   invest two   hours   outside   of   class   studying   for   every   one hour we spend together in class. The most effective way to   learn the material   is   to   complete   each chapter’s homework questions and problems immediately after we have covered the material in class.   Do   not   wait   to   study   the   material   until   just   before   a   quiz.
